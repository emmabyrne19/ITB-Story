		<h1>The Story Of ITB</h1><br>	
	
	
	<h5> The History of ITB</h5>
	<main>
	<p> The Institute of Technology Blanchardstown is steeped in history. 
		<p>The college opened its doors in 1999 which means in 2019 ITB will be celebrating an amazing 20 years.</p> 
		We will now begin to look back on the origins of ITB and how it came to be what it is today.</p>
	<br>
	<p> Its hard to imagine all the changes that have happened over the past 20 years. when ITB first opened its doors the cement was still wet because there was still construction going on around the campus, the first students of itb had to walk on planks of wood that where laid out on top of the wet concrete. The first students who attended ITB really took a chance and a risk choosing to study here, there was no google to advertize the college. The college advertized with posters and radio adds the slogan was the very catchy</p> 
	<h4> "Risktaker Maverick Join Us"</h4><br>
		
		
		<p>Ablock and Linc where the only buildings at the begining, this was until 2003. In 2004 the big building project was completed and ITB really began to fully take shape. In 2006 a marketing unit was launched, a Bebo page was set up this was the very first piece of social media created for the college. A twitter account was then created for the college so students would be able to know important information abut up and coming events and simple things such as when it will be closed</p><br>
	
	
	<h8> T.U.D</h8>
	<br><br>

	<p>2012 was a major year for ITB as work started on T.U.D, Irealnds first technological university which combined the Institute of Technology Blanchardstown, the Institute of Technology Tallaght and Dublin Institute of Technology. The legislation passed in march 2018 to for TUD to become a reality. </p>

	<h8> ITB Logo</h8>
	<br><br>
	<img src="images/IMG_0508.JPG" alt="itlogo" width="500px" height="200px">
	<p>The first logo ITB had was miles away from the one we have today, it used the colours green and red which caused problems with people who have visual problems eg colour blindness. There was many trials and tribulations to creating the logo, countless weeks and continued hard work created the perfect logo that is proudly used in 2018. Some exciting news is that there will be a brand new logo launched in January 2019, Which will also be the 20th anniversary of ITB</p>
