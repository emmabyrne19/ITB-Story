	<p> ITB is situated near buzzardstown. Buzzardstown is an ancient Irish townland that most people think was named after the birds but it was actually named after a family called the Buzzards. Larry McNutt first joined the idea of ITB in 1998 he saw the first blue prints for ITB which was for Ablock which was the first building on campus. The campus used to be a field owned by a lady who had goats and lived in a caravan. With the use of digital media today archelogy has completley changed. </p>
	<br>
	<p>100 years ago the majority of people spoke Irish and land was a huge asset after the war there was a survey created to see what land was left. When the famine struck Ireland over one million died and one million migrated to the likes of America, Australia and Canada. Big Families, older generations and younger generations mostly didnt survive the famain due to scarce food amounts and illness. The Famine to this day is something that is rarley talked about, the trvesty of it is too much to bare and the guilt is always there.</p>
	<br>
	<p> Today ITBs local area is thriving with housing being built and schools being opened, The Blanchardstown area is fastly becoming a popular area in Dublin to live in, it is full of job oppurtunites with shops and many companys including ebay setting up in the blanchardstown centre which makes the area even more desirable. </p>
