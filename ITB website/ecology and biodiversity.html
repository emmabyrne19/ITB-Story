<p>The grassland around ITB is huge it is over 22 hectares. Grassland stores carbon which can improve soil structure and is beneficial for animal wildlife. Grassland naturally transitions into scrubland. Seeds will always naturally seed. Grassland provides a habitat for rabbit’s mice and foxes that can be seen at times throughout the grounds around surrounding the campus. There are many different plat species that are important to invertebrate’s Greater knapweed support 16 varieties of butterflies, however wild grasses and herbage are required to support the caterpillar stage.</p><br>
